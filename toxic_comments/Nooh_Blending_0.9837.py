###### PLEASE NOTE ######
# Before just forking on downloading and submitting anything, please be aware that this is NOT AT ALL a standard procedure that I'm following here.
# I ususally blend submission based on weights that I get from OOF prediction with sort of a random sweep. Its more of a Greedy approach.
# But in this example its just a random blend of blends' of blends. Lol. Weights are a rough estimations of what I've done it my own ensemble.
